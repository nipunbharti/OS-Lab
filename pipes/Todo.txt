(1) Simulate the unidrectional and bidrectional pipes discussed in the class for message exchange. D
(2) Achieve the following using pipes (chose 1/2 directional appropriately):
    (a) Case conversion using (i) user conversion (ii) tr command (discussed in class)
    (b) search for specific process names using ps and grep command in a piped fashion.
    (c) simulate stream redirection and indirection using dup system call.
    [try both to/from a pipe and to/from a user created file]
(3) Develop an application in which one process sends a string to a second process which reverses the case and sends it back to the first process. (eg. iiitdm kANCHEEPURAM from one process and output to the IIITDM Kancheepuram. use bidirectional pipes.
(4) Simulate the cp command to copy source file to a destination file  using pipes.
