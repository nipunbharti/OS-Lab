(1) Generation of Prime Numbers upto a limit supplied as Command Line Parameter. D
(2) Computation of Mean, Median, Mode for an array of integers. D
(b) Read on Box Plots which is an excellent representation for data analysis which works on data medians and outliers. Construct a Box Plot for a given data (array of integers) supporting outlier as well.  (Additional Credits shall be awarded for graphical support for Box Plot Display)
(3) Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort in a multihreaded fashion. D
(4) Estimation of PI Value using Monte carlo simulation technique (refer the internet for the method..) using threads. D
(5) Computation of a Matrix Inverse using Determinant, Cofactor threads, etc. D
